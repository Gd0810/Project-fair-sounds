          <h1>Classical Music Instruments and Its Musical usages and Composer Charges</h1>
          <p>
            Indian classical music is a rich and ancient art form that has evolved over thousands of years. It is deeply rooted in tradition and is characterized by its complex melodies, intricate rhythms, and elaborate improvisations. There are two main branches of Indian classical music: Hindustani music, which is predominantly practiced in North India, and Carnatic music, which is practiced in South India.

Hindustani classical music has its origins in the Vedas, the ancient scriptures of India, and has been influenced by various cultures and traditions over the centuries. It is characterized by a system of ragas (melodic modes) and talas (rhythmic cycles). Ragas are the backbone of Hindustani music, each raga having its own unique set of melodic rules, ornamentations, and emotional associations. Talas are rhythmic patterns that provide the framework for improvisation and composition.
